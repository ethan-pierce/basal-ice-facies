'''Model enthalpy throughout an ice mass.

Given output fields from an ice dynamics simulation (e.g., velocity, effective
pressure, ice thickness), model the enthalpy field of the ice mass. This model
implements the shallow enthalpy equation described by Aschwanden et al. (2012).

    Typical usage example:

    tm = ThermalModel()

'''

class ThermalModel:

    def __init__(self):
        '''Initialize the model with ...'''
        pass
